# A Handcrafted GitHub Sponsorship Website

A minimalist sponsorship website designed to make it easy for people to support your work on GitHub. Built entirely by hand using just HTML and CSS, this project provides a clean and straightforward platform where visitors can find all the necessary information to sponsor you.

## How This Idea Clicked Me?

The idea behind this project came from the need to create a dedicated space where supporters can learn about my work and how they can contribute. In a digital age filled with complex platforms, I wanted to craft something simple and focused. By coding this project from scratch with HTML and CSS, I ensured that every element is intentional, making the process of sponsoring as clear and easy as possible.

## How to Get It Personalized for You?

1. **Fork this repository** onto your GitHub profile.
2. **Perform the desired following edits**.
3. **Host it** using any tools you prefer (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).
